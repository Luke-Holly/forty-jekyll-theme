<h2>Piaget</h2>
Jean Piaget, the French theorist, will all but certainly make an appearance on your MCAT. Here’s the minimum that you need to know about him. For more, see Mastering Piaget, where we take a deep dive.

His theory of cognitive development was comprehensive. He considered many aspects of life and tried to explain the entire developmental process. To help describe it, he divided cognitive development into distinct stages that are characterized by behavior differences.

Before describing his stages, you need to first understand the way Piaget thought about knowledge development. This was via Assimilation and Accomodation.

Assimilation is how humans perceive and adapt to new information. New experiences are interpreted to fit old ideas.

Accomodation is the reverse process, it’s changing the old ideas upon the birth of new information.

According to Piaget, people use assimilation and accommodation to interpret the world around them. Each is used in its own, proper place as children develop from birth. They are used in balance with one another as the child develops.

Now, onward to the stages:

. Piaget’s first stage is Sensorimotor. It extends from birth to the acquisition of language. Infants who are in this stage only understand physical interactions, so they construct their understanding of the world by linking physical stimuli to experiences. Not unlike the level at which a dog lives most of its life.

. The most important accomplishment in this stage is object permanence, the understanding that objects continue to exist even if they cannot be seen or hear. Peek-a-boo, the popular game, is a good way to test this. As long as the child is incredibly surprised by the reappearance of the face, they haven’t reached object permanence.

This is divided into substages which we’ll cover in more detail in the Mastering section.

The second stage is Pre-operational. This starts when the child learns to speak around age two and lasts until age seven. At this age, children do not understand concrete logic, nor can they mentally manipulate information. They do however begin to understand symbols.

Next is Concrete Operational. At this stage, from ages 7 — 11, children begin to understand and use logic. They become more “adult-like” and start solving problems logically. They do not yet understand abstraction or abstract concepts, but can complete inductive reasoning. Additionally, in this stage, egocentrism begins to fade away and children are able to understand the points of view of others.

The last stage is the Formal Operational Stage — which runs from adolescence into young adulthood. At this point, children are able to understand abstract concepts, think about thinking, and use problem-solving techniques such as trial-and-error.

Those are the basics you need to know about Piaget!
